# Jenkins tutorial

## Content

Jenkins allows developers to <mark>continuously</mark> build, test, & deploy the code to check that the application is stable. This allows for continuous development.

**Why Use Jenkinsfile?** 

Instead of creating new jobs for Jenkins via GUI, Jenkinsfile is a pipeline as a code. A pipeline is a process of deploying source code from repo to production.  

### Practical: Create Jenkinsfile

The [demo app](../docker%20tutorial/README.md) from Docker tutorial will be used. All code files wil be located there.
